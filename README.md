India have very big industry around printing. Today there are many types of printing services:

The way it works today is if a person want to print something, he has to

- Compare prices calling in or walking in (it matters if the print quantities are high)
- Provide with the document by emailing or attaching a pendrive
- Shopkeeper has to confirm for document name
- Select the printer type and print
- Pay cash/credit card


###Problem(hypothesis)

- searching for best printing service and best price is difficult
- Confidential documents may stay on service provider’s email or system
- Waiting time at providers location

For shopkeeper, 

- manual work involved around print
- No way of advertising deals available on internet
